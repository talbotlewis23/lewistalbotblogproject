                        <h2>1.0 Start by writing an ‘about me’ section about your background, why you decided to come to Code Nation and about your experience so far</h2>
                    <P>
                            I decided to come to Code Nation because IT is something I’ve always been interested in especially web design, app design as well as coding. 
                            My interest in IT sprouted in 2013, from my time doing OCR IT and Btec ICT in secondary school and my interest in IT blossomed further in 2014 with college during my time in doing Level 2 Game Design. 
                            After that I attended a level 1 IT  course in 2015 with both of these taking place at Oldham College around 2017. Later that year, around September I attended an IT Traineeship via a company called QA which lasted 3. 
                            I furthered my IT skills at a place called Reform Radio in early 2018 editing audio via Reaper and editing promo material via Adobe Creative Cloud. Lastly, as of mid 2019, I am here at code nation.

 <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
    </h2>
    <P>
        One of the easiest way to succeed in any IT project is to simply know your software, don’t utilise anything you're unfamiliar with.
        The tools I would use for say a website development project would be those that utilise HTML such as Adobe Dreamweaver. 
        I would utilise Adobe Creative Cloud for any graphics that I would require for the project as well as Adobe Photoshop for any image, just in case the client has an intended vision for the project. 
        Through these I would utilise all that I learnt at college as well as other skills I’ve picked up on the way. 
        Lastly, I would utilise PNG for image purely due to the fact that it doesn’t decrease in quality on being compressed.
        Skills such as being able to utilise the polygon lasso tool within Creative Cloud or the magic wand tool to delete any unwanted sections fo any image.
</P>
<br>
    <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.
    </h2> 
    <P>Simple, I would allocate ample time for each page to be made and tested. For example, Images I would design on Monday morning and edit them on that same afternoon or allocate time for testing and debugging for the entirety of Thursday before submitting for approval on the day after on Friday. 
        Lastly I would organise this by utilising Trello an online notepad board.
        </P>
        
        <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail, Why? 
</h2>
<p>One thing that can impact a digital project is sometimes something you can’t control.The tech your using such as a laptop or a piece of software can develop issues whether it’s updating at critical point or for unknown reason isn’t cooperating. 
    The most common reason a digital project can fail is simple human error whether it comes from a typo with the code or simply a typo with a piece of text or more significantly, you simply not managing your time properly which will cause your project to fail.
    </p>
<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
    </h2>
    <P>The simply way to choose would be to know which software/ IT software to utilise could be to do some research via google to look for reviews.
        Furthermore, searching for something that embodies these three aspects speed, price and user friendly-ness plus matching up to parameter of the project you are undertaking.
        </P>
<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
    </h2>
    <p>Trello is an immensely useful tool for project planning purely on how easy and streamlined it can make the planning process easier not mention whilst the projects on the way. In addition, Git as well as GitHub can be a huge help in that you can easily archive any code that you do as to help others.
        </p>
        <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
            </h2>
            <p>If their is a data breach, your business can receive a hefty fine such as British Airways which were fined up to 200 million euros and Marriot International being fined up to 99 million euros. 
                Further more, GDPR applies to any business that deals with personal data.It means your business will have to appoint a data protection officer.

                    <br>
                    <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
                    <P>
First page is simply an introduction to myself with that being put into seperate paragraphs for personal catorgory (info,background in IT and how I found code nation) and wrapping this text in a nice green box with a dark green border.
Second page is simply project justification and the how why I am doing this project and why i am doing them.Furhtermore it demonstraints  my knowledge on the constraints put on web designers such as copywrite.Lastly, showing of my knowledge of GDPR.
Third page is simply reviewing all that I have accomplished on this project. Furthermore, I would go onby saying what I would do better on a second try as well as lamenting on what i could have done better on the project I have comlpeted.
To finish off, I will add a nav bar to every page to link them together.

                <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
<P>Copyright can apply to your website if you use am image of iconography of a large compony such as Coco Cola or Pepsi Cola. If any intellectual properties owned by the two companies are used by any other company on say website then your company could get in to legal trouble.
    In spite of the web obsessed world we live in, the general perception of design tends to be framed like a print, like how a billboards are general the same size plus a magazine cover page are often the same size in spite matter of the person observing it. 
</P>

<P>        
People often need to be able to view a webpage on a multitude of platforms(PC, Android, mobile)
        And thus meaning you are constrained to designing your website to fit as many platforms as possible. 
        </P>

<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
<p>A common issue that can face the disabled when it comes to web access is accessibility, if one is deaf then how can they access your website, if your website is a video streaming site then how can they watch without subtitles. 
    The blind to partially sighted may struggle to utilise your website also.
    </p>
<P>The way you can over come such programmes for example is to include include subtitles for any form of visual aid as well as audio guides for those who are only partially sighted and for those who are completely blind. 
    These are some ways That the disabled are effect when ti comes to websites and how we can over them.
    </P>
    <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
<P>There are a multitude of different image formats that can be used for web design here a few of them.

        JPG, it’s definitely the most common image formats, it boasts a small file size as well as a barely noticeable  quality loss.PNG, this format doesn’t lose any of its image quality when it is compressed  plus know quality losses when it is saved but it does boast a high a mage file. 
        GIF, much like Jpeg it boasts a small file size making it perfect for animations but these animations can only boast a few colours.TIF, its core strength is having the quality out of all the formats but its file size is enormous even when compared to PNGs, best used for commercial print work.
