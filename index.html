<h2>Introduction</h2>


<div>Greetings Digital Traveller!</div>

<div >
<BR>
<p>
My name, if don't know is Lewis Talbot and this is my blog.I am 21 years old and I was born and raised in Failsworth.
If I'm not looking through social media then I'm keeping my ear to the floor when it comes to news iether it's about politics,
music, tech and gaming etc etc. When I choose to relax I play video games such as Destiny 2, Fallout 4(when it doesn't crash)
as well as Minecraft once every blue moon.Lastly I may or may not have an addiction to building Gundpla.

<h2><div>My background and how I got into tech</div></h2>
<Br>

 <p>
<div>My background starts in secondary school with OCR IT (2013)which ignited my passion for IT because it showed me a way to do what I'm 
passionate about.In this I was properly intoduced to such software as Adobe Photoshop,Dreamweaver and Adobe Fireworks.After that
had concluded I then went on too college and did a L2 Game Design cource(2014-2015) which further reinforced my IT software skills with Adobe
Photoshop and by the end I decided to go for a L1 IT course (2015-2016) to help further my skills with Adobe Photoshop as well as Adobe Dreamweaver
through these I made my first website(which was to advertise the Blackpool beachfront) after that(2016 early 2017) I spent my time doing little things just to keep 
myself busy such as reworking famous logos and later that year I found QA apprenticeships(2017 early 2018) for which I did a lot of the fundamentals of hardware and software
plus the inner working of a computer tower.As of now (2019) I am attending a Code nation course.</div>

<h2><div>Code nation</div></h2>


<p>
<div>I was Introduced to Code Nation through an organisation called 'Ingeus' which introudced me to CN and from their I learned of the various cources that they offered. After it was a simple of choosing the course that best suit me and that course was Coding,app and web development.I am hoping by the end of this to perhaps attend the bootcamp.</div>
