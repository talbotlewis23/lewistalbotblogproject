        <h2>Unit 1(outcome reviews 1-3)</h2>
<div>
        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as
                needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools
                you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
                <p>
I am happy for the most part.To ellaborate, The tools I am happy with is trello and visual studio code because through Trello I managed to
keep on track with all aspects of my project from font to divs,I knew exactly what I was doing and I never lost where I was up to. Through 
visual code studio I was able to make the website in the first place furthermore I found VSC to be rather intuitive to use and utilise due to each 
function shall we say being colour coded to make it eaier to Identify each function as I was it and easily correct flaws.
<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g.
        Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
        <P>
 Yes all IT tools were very much appropriate.VSC made the coding for this project easy and understandable,without it I wouldn't be here writing this review.
 Additonally,VSC made it easy to check back and forth with projects I am working on being able to view the result of my coding and make adjustment in real time.
 Trello was appropriate simply because it's an amazing tool for organisation with organisational skills being vital to this project.With Trello I was able to easily keep track 
 of where i was up to.
 </P>
 <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are
        you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on
        the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you
        change? </h2>
        <P>
One of my projects key strengths is the visual choice with a nice cityscape background and a simple large text box emcomposing all text for which is wrapped in. 
All text is visually appealling and easy to read and is laid out simply.My planning was also top notch as due to trello.The weaknesses of my project are as follows,time, the single week we got for the purpose of reviewing the project 
and making the project was simply inadequite.
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2>
<p>
        The only further improvement I can think would be to use Adobe Dreamweaver, as good VSC is Dreamweaver is simply faster. Due to tools availible within the software.
        Another further improvement would be a collaberative effort for this project because of the simple fact that the project would be done alot faster,which would make way for bug 
        testing and refinement.
        If I had more time,my blog would have more pages giving an overview of my project,giving anyone viewing it a chance to recreate what I've made not mention a nave bar where when you scroll over it the links ahve an animation that changes their appearence.
</p>
<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
<P>
                2.1 Preparing appropriate content for your site 
                I prepared appropriate content by researching appropriate media such as for a background image as well as researching the appropriate content that related directly to project objectives.I mad sure nothing I added to this project ever deviated from the project core objectives.
</P>
                2.6 Error free pages that are fit for purpose 
                All my pages are perfect without a single error with links all going where there supposed to and absolutly no typos.All pages have appropriate to what has been set for this project.
             <p>
                2.3 Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation 
                I selected for this project appropriate techniques such as making sure all the paragraphs and headers are equally spaced out and furthermore all text was centred to make for a easier reading experience not mention an easy to read font.Additonally, the text is a white colour which works well with the simple colurs of my text box's.
        </p>
                <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in
                                terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more
                                efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in
                                teams? </h2>
<P>
If I had additional time to make this blog I would utilse the time effectively to make a additonal content to the content already present on my blog.If I had acces to say Adobe photoshop,Dreamweaver I am confident that the resulting site would be far serprior to site I've mangage given the time allocated.Any proposition of teamwork within the actual project for obvious reasons such as allocation of tasks for on overall more efficicient construction process.The benefits of using VCS are that the code your suing is easlily laid outin front of you but has been proven to be tad finniky at times.Trello was great for orgainisation as it functioned as a digital noteboard but it wasn't good for much esle.
<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
<P>
To put more empahasis on this,time,it's something I think everyone within the group wanted but due to things outside my control this additonal time could never be granted.With teamwork I could allocated particular aspects of the blog to different people as this would speed up devopemnt significantly.
</p>
<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital
                projects – what would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use
                of Slack? </h2>
<P>
I would hybridise the process by using Slack whilst in conjucture with a team of 4 members as to better utilse the time we had been allocated for this project meaning as we worked in tandem with eachother we could share notes for solutions on particular problems and achieve succes for this project alot faster.
</P>
<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2>
<p>
I would brainstorm with other within my group to come up with the most time effective result possible solution for a particular problem such as say we need to allocate space for a nav bar and decide should the individual buttons be in different,random colours or should they be colurs that correspond to the individual page themes.We then make the solution we deem neccesessary as on when we come up with them and make sure we always aware of time.
